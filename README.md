# RIT Assignment Tracker & CR Portal

Amidst the lockdown, educational institutions were forced to take academic activities online with a number of assignments, tests and projects being assigned to students frequently.

Since there was no common bulletin to post and manage these announcements and tasks, Class Representatives and lecturers would resort to informal WhatsApp Group Chats to convey these messages which more often than not get lost in the cluster of personal messages.

To solve this problem Aakash Pothepalli and I have developed a portal featuring a Website ( https://lnkd.in/g4SWSKf ) and an app ( https://github.com/teamimpracticalcoders/MSRIT-CR-Portal ) offering a host of services to students and the CRs.

Assignment/Exam details can be reached easily on the website, and the same can be managed by CRs using the app.

## Features of the website

* Separate page for every class

* Real-time sync with the DB

* Tabs - Exams, Notices, Assignments

* Dark mode ( duh )

## Features of the app

* Full CRUD operations

* Attach links and set deadlines

* Simple and elegant UI with Dark Mode

* Fluid animations

* Secure and fool proof
